        var message = `Dear Representative,


Israel is committing war crimes and genocide.

On Wednesday 15th November, you will vote on a resolution to introduce sanctions on Israel by the following means:

- Withdraw the diplomatic status of the Israeli ambassador.

- To cease trade with internationally illegal Israeli settlements by enacting the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018.

- To divest Ireland of and stop further Irish funding for Israeli businesses tied to settlements by enacting the Illegal Israeli Settlements Divestment Bill 2023.

- Advocate for economic sanctions on Israel at EU level, including suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement and suspension of the EU-Israel Horizon Europe Association Agreement and Israel’s access to the €95 billion Horizon Europe fund for research and innovation.

- Intensify the Irish call for an immediate ceasefire.

- Make a referral to the International Criminal Court to investigate the Israeli government and military for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity.

As my representative, I urge you to vote for this resolution.

I will read the full transcript of this Dáil meeting and if you vote against this, you will not receive my vote again.

Please consider the following breaches of international law and war crimes that deem this resolution both necessary and justified:

- Israel has murdered over 5,000 children and babies.

- Israel has murdered almost 12,000 people, with at least 3,000 still trapped under rubble.

- Israel has attacked and injured almost 30,000 civilians, more than half of them women and children.

- Israel is starving over 2 million besieged Gazan people of food, water and medicine, denying them their most fundamental human rights. Many are preventably dying of dehydration and starvation because Israel has turned off their water supply and is blocking food supplies.

 - Israel has now invaded Gaza on the ground, where the Israeli soldiers are shooting and killing with impunity. There is verified footage of tank shelling and arms fire in densely populated civilian streets. Civilians are dying from ground combat and the Israeli government has said it will continue this invasion with "full force".

- Israel has deliberately bombed 21 hospitals, including intensive care units, 246 schools and education facilities, multiple mosques and churches, UN facilities and countless residential buildings with families inside. Israel continues to do so.

- Israel claims these are places where Hamas is hiding, but has not shared any verified intel or concrete evidence of this. They have said, without verification, that they have killed 60 members of Hamas. With almost 12,000 civilians dead, this is a 0.5% accuracy rate in targeted kills. That means that 99.5% of the people Israel has murdered are innocent. This is utterly foul and cannot be allowed to go unpunished or unanswered for.

- Israel has forced medical staff out of hospitals, where they have left sick and injured children and babies, including premature babies, alone to die.

- There is verified footage of Israeli snipers shooting medical staff as they exit hospitals holding up white flags.

- Israel is attacking first responders and ambulances during rescue efforts. 53 ambulances have been destroyed and over 200 medical staff murdered.

- Israel is deliberately killing journalists who have been actively exposing their war crimes, alongside their families. 48 journalists are dead so far.

- Israel is ethnically cleansing Gaza of its native Palestinian population. This is one of many serious breaches of international human rights law by Israel.

- Israel has forcibly displaced over 1.5 million civilians and is bombing the designated "safe route". Both are war crimes.

- Israel has repeatedly attacked Rafah and the Rafah crossing, continually blocking fuel and almost all international aid, and killing civilians. Another war crime.

- Israel's illegal aggressions in the West Bank are also incredibly alarming and indicative of the apartheid regime Israel perpetuates. Israel has murdered at least 178 Palestinian  people here, including 45 children. Israel has displaced at least 1,000 Palestinian people in the West Bank, including 145 children. Israel has detained over 2,200 Palestinians in the West Bank, largely leading to indefinite administrative detention without trial. This is in addition to the 2,070 Palestinian prisoners inside Israeli jails already, many without fair trial and at least 160 of whom are children.

- The Israeli government have failed to investigate incidents of torture and death of Palestinians in their custody over the past month, as they are legally bound to do, by international law.

As my representative, I require you to note that according to survivor testimony and official footage released by the Israeli government, many of the Israeli civilians killed on October 7th were in fact shot with IDF bullets. Apache helicopter pilots have admitted to firing continuously without intelligence on targets, while tank crews have confirmed they were ordered to shell homes, regardless of whether there were Israelis inside or not. See the testimony of Israeli survivor Yasmin Porat and drone footage from the Israeli government for clarification. Israel’s influential finance minister and settler leader, Bezalel Smotrich, urged the Israeli army to “hit Hamas brutally and not take the matter of the captives into significant consideration” during a cabinet meeting late on 7 October as the Hamas attack was still underway. Echoing the controversial "Hannibal Directive" Israeli officials used to justify any means to prevent the capture of IDF soldiers.

Additionally Israeli hostages report being treated with dignity by Hamas fighters. See the full testimony of Yocheved Lifshitz for clarification. She reports that Hamas fighters told the hostages "they would not harm us", a doctor tended to them regularly, that good care was taken of the wounded and that "they treated us gently and met all our needs."

These reports stand in stark contrast to the dominant narrative in the West and sharply highlight the lack of accuracy of Western reporting and the bias within our Irish media. The citizens of Ireland will not stand for this lack of truth.

Directly compare these testimonies with the inhumane and degrading treatment of Palestinian prisoners in the West Bank by the Israeli military. This treatment includes severely beating, starving, stripping, blindfolding, tying up and urinating on Palestinian prisoners, evidenced in video footage and interviews, both conducted and verified by Amnesty International.

Any rhetoric suggesting that the actions listed fall under "Israel's right to self-defence" is a moral, legal and political failure. Furthermore, there is a debate as to whether it’s possible for a settler-colony to self-defend, or is this simply a euphemism for furthering colonial occupation. Regardless, what Israel is doing is categorically not self-defence. War crimes and crimes against humanity must be answered for.

I urge you to unequivocally condemn the Israeli apartheid regime and to condemn this genocide. Pass this resolution. Vote to remove the diplomatic status of the Israeli ambassador, vote to refer the Israeli government to the ICC, pass the aforementioned bills to impose trade sanctions on Israel and vote to push trade sanctions at an EU level.

The patience of the Irish people has run dry. Your action is needed now. Vote for this resolution or lose the faith of the Irish electorate.

You represent the Irish people and you have an obvious mandate in this regard. We are telling you, in clear language, exactly what we need you to do this Wednesday. Do not fail.

Sincerely,
